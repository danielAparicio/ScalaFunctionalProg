  //LAZY VALS GENERAL:
  /*is a good practice in seq prog to initialize the lazy val with an expression that does not
  depends on the current state, in concurrent prog is more importante as lazy vals are affected
  by non determinism
  a lazy val is initialized at most once, if it;s not required it will never be initizalized*/

  //Override val/def abstract with a lazy val
